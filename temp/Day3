Work your way up to the root

File Creation Mask
File creation mask determines default permissions
If no mask were used permissions would be:
	777 for directories
	666 for files

The umask Command
umask [-S] [mode]
Sets the file creation mask to mode, if given
Use -S to for symbolic notation

 					Directory 		File
Base Permission    		777      	666 
Subtract Umask     		-022     	-022 
Creations Permission 	755 		644

Octal Subtraction Is an Estimation
 					Directory 		File
Base Permission 		777 		666
Subtract Umask 			-007 		-007
Creations Permission    770			660*
