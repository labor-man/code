What Is the Shell?
- user interface
	- the command line interface(default interface)
		- A program thar accepts your commands and executes those commands
		- Also called a command line interpreter
	- the graphical interface
(The graphical interface is also a shell, However, if someone isn't specific and they say shell, they're typically talking about the command line interface.)


Command Line interface vs a GUI 
- The command line is more powerful
- There will always be a command line
- Server ditributions do not include GUIs
- Desktop distributions have GUIs and CLIs

two kinds of "root"
- the beginning of the file system
- OR the superuser account named root

Root, the Superuser
- Root access is typically restricted to system administrators
- Root access may be required to to install, start, or stop an application
(You may need root access if you're going to install an application that resides outside of your home directory.)
- Day to day activities will be performed using a normal account.

 Tilde Expansion(expand to that account's home directory.)
 -	~jason = /home/jason
 -	~root = /root
 -	~ftp = /srv/ftp
 (services often have their own accounts.)
